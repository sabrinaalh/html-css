    <blockquote cite="https://slipsum.com/">
        You think water moves fast? You should see ice. <br>
         It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got <br>
        a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. <br>
         Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that <br>
        seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. <br>
         Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was <br>
          the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it <br>
           doesn't hold a candle to man.
